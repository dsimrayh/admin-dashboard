# Admin Dashboard

This is my submission for The Odin Project's "Admin Dashboard" project. 

I did not recreate the design template. I decided to build a more professional looking project to challenge myself and emulate a more real-world scenario.  

This main focus of this project is layout and design using CSS, with an emphasis on CSS Grid. Very little JavaScript was used for small pieces of functionality. This is mainly a design mockup to showcase my knowledge and abilities with HTML and particularly CSS. There were plenty of challenges in this project, but with little JS involved, this allowed me to really test and refine both my HTML and CSS skills.
